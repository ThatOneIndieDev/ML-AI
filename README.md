# Ecommerce AI ChatBot

The following project is my first formal AI project made in python using TensorFlow and Keras. As my first project to be posted on GitHub, I wanted to keep it something simple and something I can be proud of to share as a beginner on my AI/ML journey.

## Installation

Use the package manager to pip to install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/).

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install nltk
```

## Usage
Usage of any and all packages can be found both inside the code and the file requirements.txt
